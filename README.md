# Hospital-Management-System-Project-Console-Using-Python
The Hospital Management System is a Python program that can arrange an appointment with doctors. The sole purpose of the system is to organize the patient data and make the appointment meeting convenient for both doctor and patient. This program was developed using only Python language.

The project is a console application where you can navigate via entering certain numeric keys. The system can make users work faster and reliable when it comes to inputting data. Using this system you can efficiently check the patient details such as the room detail, appointed doctor, and departments. The system is consists of two users, the Client, and the Admin. The admin side is protected by an encrypting password before accessing the features, after login he/she is responsible for inputting patient info, setting an appointment, doctor info, and updating the status. While the user is only capable of viewing the available doctors, patient details, appointed meetings, and available departments.
